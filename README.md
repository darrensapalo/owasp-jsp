OWASP on JSP
=========
This is a github project containing JSP implementations of the 2013 OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Initially, this was a group project of the following people:

- RJ Cal on A1-2
- Adrianto Puji Irawan on A3
- Julius Bautista on A4
- Kharriz Abiyasa Bhimabrata on A5
- Carl Angelo Chan on A6
- Pauline Rivera on A7
- Bobby Cruz on A8
- Darren Sapalo on A9
- Jefferson Cordero on A10

Some of their projects were not pushed into the repository. This was a partial deliverable for the **SECUDEV** (Secure Development) course of **De La Salle University Manila** in the Academic Year 2014-2015 Term 1 under Sir [Danny Cheng](http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/faculty/fis/faculty_info.asp?fac_id=103921818).

## OWASP Top 10 2013, from A1-A10 on the Java platform

### A8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery

> Attacker creates forged HTTP requests and tricks a victim into submitting them via image tags, XSS, or numerous other techniques. If the user is authenticated, the attack succeeds. (OWASP A8, 2013)

### A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

> Attacker identifies a weak component through scanning or manual analysis. He customizes the exploit as needed and executes the attack. It gets more difficult if the used component is deep in the application. (OWASP A9, 2014)
